<h1>The Backstory</h1>
<p>Granny's origin, and what she actually is, is never mentioned in-game. Her house is found isolated in a dense forest,<br> which means that she may be a demon or an entity. However, this makes a bit of plot hole,<br> because in Slendrina X, Slendrina was trapped in a book. </p>
