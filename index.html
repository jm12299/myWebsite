  <h1>The Backstory </h1>            
         
<p>Granny's origin, and what she actually is, is never mentioned in-game. Her house is found isolated in a dense forest,<br> which means that she may be a demon or an entity. However, this makes a bit of plot hole,<br> because in Slendrina X, Slendrina was trapped in a book.Granny is the titular and the main antagonist in the game of the same name and Sequel<br> of the same name and one of the enemies in the game, the others being Spider Mom and her pets like the Spider<br> and the Crow. Granny is also one of the two main antagonists in Granny: Chapter Two. As of January 7, 2021, she also appears in Dvloper's latest game<br> The twins along with grandpa. She is also the mother of Slendrina's Mom, and the maternal grandmother of Slendrina. She keeps the Player locked inside of her house, <br> forcing them to avoid her in order to solve the puzzles required to escape the house.
